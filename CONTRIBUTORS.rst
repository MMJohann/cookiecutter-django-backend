This project is based on `cookiecutter-django <https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django>`_. However,
it is quite different. This project removes all AWS dependencies, the settings have been simplified
(it is no longer necessary to execute a command with each change...), uses a standard web server (Nginx),
remove Pytest because Django uses unittest by default, Django's structure is standard, it has no templates
by default, does not overwrite the Django login... and many more changes.
